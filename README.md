# univsuldataset
Univsul is a free brainwave dataset.
The dataset has been recorded from six health person,
Each subject has normal mental state, normal color vision, and age ranging 30 ± 5.
The dataset has been made for two main categories which are: colors and
shapes. Red and green colors were used in the color mode. According to
the RGB standard, the red color was constructed by setting the red value to
255, while both green and blue values were set to zero (255, 0, 0). The green
color is constructed by setting the green value to 255, with both red and blue
value being zero (0, 255, 0). Forward and right arrows have been selected
for the shape category.
All sessions of brainwave signals have been recorded
under two modes, which were: visible and invisible. In the visible mode,
subjects focused on the colors and shapes presented to them. However, in
the invisible mode, subjects thought about specific colors or the shape with
closed eyes.
The recording has been administrated for each participant in a dark room. Each subject has been seated on a comfortable chair
faced with a 43 inch screen. The screen was set to standard color mode with normal brightness and contrast. The distance between the subjects and the screen was 125 centimeters.

Each session have two subsessions i.e. red, green for colors and forward, right for arrows, each subsession is recorded for 25 seconds

Two separate CSV files have been created for each sub-sessions and individual subjects. The first file stores the raw EEG signals with its time, while the second file contains recording time, brainwave band (α, β, γ, δ, and θ)
values, attention level, meditation level, blinking strength, and signal quality level.

All folder with I letter releveant to invisble mode.
